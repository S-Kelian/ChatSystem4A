**Autors: Kalian Sebaici, Th√©ophile Zenou-Truchot**

This project aims to deliver a peer-to-peer app for communication on a local network. It provides an easy way to communicate within a company. It must be easy to use and easy to install.
The app runs on the version 17 of the Java Development Kit and Maven.

With the current version you will be able to :
  - create a profile by setting a pseudo
  - change your password and inform other people on the network
  - automatically/periodically update the list of the users currently connected on the network

First you will need to clone the repository on your machine using this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/insa-4ir-chatsystem/chatsystem-sebaici-zenou-truchot.git
```
Use the following command lines on your machine to launch the app:

mvn clean package
```
```
java -jar target/ChatSytem-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
